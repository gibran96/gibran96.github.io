I'm a Computer Science Graduate student at Northeastern University. I'm currently looking for Software Engineering Internships or Co-ops for Summer 2024. My areas of interest are Full Stack development, Software Architecture, and DevOps and Automation.

### Other Interests
I love to play the guitar, and I'm a huge fan of The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and 
John Mayer. I also follow soccer, and I'm a supporter of Manchester United. I like playing the game 
too, and try to play at least once a week.
