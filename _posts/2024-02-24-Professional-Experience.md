## Full Stack Engineer at Cognizant Technology Solutions
### Nov 2021 - May 2023
At Cognizant Technology Solutions, I worked as a Full Stack Engineer for our client Farmer's 
Insurance. I was in the team that was involved with the development and maintenance of the Auto 
Insurance website. My role was to work on the front-end and back-end of the website. Using this 
web application, users could get a quote for their auto insurance, and purchase a policy. <br> 
The website was undergoing a major revamp, and we were tasked with migrating the existing website 
that used legacy technologies to a modern tech stack. We used Angular for the front-end, and 
Java Spring Boot for the back-end.<br>
I was also involved in the development of the new CICD pipelines for the website. We used Jenkins
and Cloudbees CD for the deployments.

  and reach by 9%.

  productivity by 30%.

  Spring Boot, which replaced the old application built using legacy technology.

  thereby increasing the number of quote completions by users.

#### Tech Stack
- Angular 13

#### Learnings
- I learned how to work in a large team, and how to manage dependencies and work in a 
  collaborative environment.

  communicate effectively with my team.
- I learned how to work with a large codebase, and how to manage the complexity of a large 
  application.

  how to work with a client to understand their requirements, and how to translate that into a 
  working application.

## Software Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services
### Sept 2018 - Oct 2021
At Tata Consultancy Services, I worked as a Software Engineer for our client, ABN Amro. I was
involved in the development and maintenance of the bank's intranet banking applications. Our 
team worked the new Cross Border payments application, that allowed the bank's employees to 
create new payments and manage existing ones. <br>
The application also contained a live tracker of the payments, that showed each stage of the
payment's lifecycle. I was responsible for the development of this tracker. It was a big step in 
the direction of improving the bank's payment processing capabilities and the efficiency of the 
bank employees in being able to track customer payments. The process involved a lot of 
discussions with the stakeholders, and understanding the requirements of the bank's employees.<br>
The IT teams in ABN Amro were undergoing a DevOps transformation, and I was involved in 
migrating the application to Microsoft Azure. We used Azure DevOps for the CICD pipelines.

#### Highlights
- Redesigned intranet banking applications for ABN Amro using legacy frameworks and updated the 
  apps with Spring Boot and Angular 9. Increased the user-friendliness and the robustness of the 
  applications, making the apps easier to maintain, and reducing customer response time by 30%.
- Developed a real time tracker for cross-border payments as part of the SWIFT Global Payment 
  Initiative, to provide faster, simpler, and transparent payment information.
- The tracker increased the bank employees' productivity and speed in tracking payments by 40%.
- Built scalable and cost-effective applications by spearheading DevOps to migrate the bankâ€™s 
  intranet application to Microsoft Azure cloud.

#### Tech Stack
- Angular 9
- Java Spring Boot
- Azure DevOps
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle SQL
- IBM DB2
- JIRA
- Confluence
- Bitbucket
- Jenkins
- SonarQube

#### Learnings
- This was my first job out of college, and I learned how to work in a professional environment.
- I did not have previous experience with Angular and Spring Boot, and I learned these 
  technologies on the job, through online courses and by working with my team.
- My role required a lot of communication with the bank's employees, and I learned how to 
  communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders.
- I learned the importance of writing clean and maintainable code, and how to work with a large 
  codebase.
